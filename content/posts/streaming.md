## VPN

It is better to use VPN to stream videos. I would recommend [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com). It costs about 5.39 C$/month. It could increase the speed and it is also good for security and privacy. It will also allow you to watch Netflix & Amazon Prime videos that are not available in your country.

## JustWatch
